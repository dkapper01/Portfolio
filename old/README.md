# Portfolio
This is my personal website I built from scratch. I didn't use any libraries or frameworks just plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I made this website because I wanted to show my projects to friends but mainly to future employers. While making it I realized this is the perfect opportunity to tell about myself. My goal is to try my best to honestly express who I am and my skills. I included social media links and even news about myself.  The more you click on the best I can express myself.
